              <p>Wearable technology includes any form of computing that is designed to be worn by the user, whether it's embedded into the clothing or worn as an accessory. Many wearables, such as smart pedometers, overlap somewhat with health and safety as the device is both wearable and intended to help improve your personal health.</p>
              <p>Today’s infographic not only highlights the history of wearable technology, but it also shows the noticeable acceleration in the advancement and adoption of new innovations.
